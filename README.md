# Safari Match-3 Game

This is a small project developed to follow a course on game development for mobile devices with Unity.

It is a simple match-3 game using Kenney's Animal Pack 2D art asset and the Unity game engine.

> *Note: I developed this project as part of a coursework training in Unity Mobile Game Development provided by Platzi.*
